    "There is no doubt that generative AI tools (LLMS like ChatGPT, Codex, Claude, Gemini etc) have revolutionized coding. You will can/should/need to learn to use AI in your coding as you move forward in this course and beyond. AI-assisted coding is now common practice. In many real projects, people work “agentically” with AI, meaning you describe what you want to do, ask for help exploring or writing code, and then carefully read, test, and correct the results. The thinking and responsibility stay with you, but AI can speed up the trial and error and help you learn more efficiently. Those concepts are too advanced for this course, but LLMs are fantatic tools for helping you code, telling you how a function works, finding bugs, suggesting syntax etc. (See the syllabus for the explicit AI-use policy for this course.)\n",
